# My first HTML page - Sit on Chair

This is my first HTML page made after first week at Coders Lab bootcamp. 

My task was to copy as good as I can a website layout which Coders Lab provided (https://ibb.co/kSsKhU) and I've tried my best to do it ;)

However I've started to build it after the first week of the course with the basic knowledge which increased higly during bootcamp so It's going to be a good memory of how difficult begginings are ;)
